**What Will I Build?**
The Memory Game Project is all about demonstrating your mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You’ll build a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration). But this isn’t just any memory game! It’s a snazzy, well-designed, and feature-packed memory game!

**How It Works**
If you're unfamiliar with the game, the rules are very simple; flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. Each turn:

A player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol
The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol
If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

**What Will I Learn?**
The memory game presents the first opportunity to fully combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a large project. Aside from solidifying your skills with these three technologies, you'll learn how best to combine them in a complex application. What's the ideal workflow? How many files do you need? Do you write the HTML first? The JavaScript?
