To run this project, try running index.html project in updated and latest browsers with working internet connection for downloading required libraries.

# **What Will I Build?**

The Memory Game Project is all about demonstrating your mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You’ll build a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration). But this isn’t just any memory game! It’s a snazzy, well-designed, and feature-packed memory game!

# **How It Works**

If you're unfamiliar with the game, the rules are very simple; flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. Each turn:
@@ -16,12 +18,6 @@ If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

# **What Will I Learn?**

The memory game presents the first opportunity to fully combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a large project. Aside from solidifying your skills with these three technologies, you'll learn how best to combine them in a complex application. What's the ideal workflow? How many files do you need? Do you write the HTML first? The JavaScript?
